# COVID-19 Death and Vaccination Rates in the United States

## Overview
This repository presents an analytical exploration of COVID-19 death trends, contributing health conditions, and vaccination rates across the United States. The project integrates data analysis in **Python** and **Tableau** using CDC datasets to visualize regional, temporal, and demographic factors that influenced COVID-19 outcomes.

The work was conducted as a comprehensive data analysis project to identify correlations between vaccination efforts and death rates, while examining disparities among states, age groups, and health conditions.

## Objectives
- Analyze U.S. COVID-19 death rates over time, with breakdowns by **state** and **age group**  
- Examine the **impact of comorbidities** such as respiratory and circulatory diseases  
- Identify **regional and socioeconomic disparities** in per-capita death tolls  
- Correlate **vaccination rates** with subsequent decreases in COVID-19 deaths  
- Create **interactive dashboards** that allow exploration by time, region, and demographic factors  

---

## Methodology
- **Data Sources:** Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provisional death and vaccination datasets (2020–2023)  
- **Data Cleaning:** Addressed inconsistencies and missing totals in CDC datasets; relied on calculated sums for accuracy  
- **Tools Used:**  
  - **Python:** Data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature engineering  
  - **Tableau:** Visualization and dashboard creation for interactive exploration  

### Key Dashboards
1. **COVID-19 Deaths by State and Age:** Concentrations of deaths among older populations, especially in the Southeast  
2. **Contributing Conditions:** Major causes such as respiratory and circulatory diseases and their distribution across age groups  
3. **Vaccination vs. Death Rates:** Relationship between rising vaccination rates and declining deaths  
4. **Regional Overview:** Comparison of per-capita death and vaccination rates across U.S. regions  

---

## Key Findings
- **Southeastern states** showed higher death rates and lower vaccination rates  
- **Elderly populations (55+)** accounted for over **90% of COVID-19 deaths**  
- **Respiratory and circulatory conditions** were the most common comorbidities  
- **Vaccination uptake** tended to rise following death-rate peaks  
- **Data inconsistencies** in CDC files emphasize the need for improved reporting standards  

---

## Results Summary
- States with **high vaccination rates** (e.g., Connecticut, Massachusetts) had **lower death rates**, while **southern states** experienced higher mortality  
- Seasonal peaks occurred during **winter months**, particularly in **January**  
- The **Northeast** maintained both higher vaccination coverage and lower per-capita deaths
